   kubectl get pods -n jenkins
   ```
5. Access the Jenkins pod shell to view the workspace:
   ```bash
   # Replace <jenkins-pod-name> with your actual Jenkins pod name
   kubectl exec -it <jenkins-pod-name> -n jenkins -- /bin/bash
    ```

## 🧰 Tips for Beginners

- Try changing the shell command to print something else
- Add more build steps to experiment (e.g., `date`, `ls`, `uname -a`)
- Explore Post-build Actions like archiving logs or sending emails
- There many other build options like discarding old builds, setting build triggers, etc. Explore them as you get comfortable.
