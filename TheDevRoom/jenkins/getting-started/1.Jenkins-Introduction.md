# 🔄 Jenkins CI/CD Concepts Guide

This guide explains the fundamentals of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**, with Jenkins as the primary tool.

---

## 🚀 Continuous Integration (CI)

**Definition:** Continuous Integration is the process of **automating the build and testing** of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.

### ✅ Benefits of CI
- 🐞 Detects bugs as early as possible
- 📜 Maintains a detailed history for reference
- ⚙️ Eliminates manual integration steps in the software lifecycle
- 📦 Ensures a deployable system is available at any time

---

## 🚚 Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Definition:** CD automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments.

### 🧪 CD Flow (Manual Deployment)
```
Code Done → Unit Tests → Integrate → Acceptance Tests → Manual Deployment to Production
```
**Use Case:** External Projects

---

## 🤖 Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Definition:** Like Continuous Delivery, but includes **automated production deployment**.

### ⚙️ CD Flow (Automated Deployment)
```
Code Done → Unit Tests → Integrate → Acceptance Tests → Auto Deployment to Production
```
**Use Case:** Internal or In-house Projects

- 📊 Generates test reports (e.g., JUnit)
- 🏗️ Pushes builds to artifact repositories (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory)
- 🚀 Deploys builds to production or testing environments
- ✉️ Sends notifications (Email, Slack, etc.) about build status
